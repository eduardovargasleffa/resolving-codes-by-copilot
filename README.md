## Resolving codes in Python with Github Copilot and in Codespace


1 - Concatening data üêæ
Description: We will receive two differents pieces of data from the user and concatenate them into a single string.


What will we learn? 

- String manipulation
- Concatenation
- Data entry
- Efficient use of Github Copilot

2 - Repeating texts  ‚úèÔ∏è
Description: Now, we will request a string and an integer number as input. Then we will have to return the string repeated string the number of times informed.

What will we learn?

- String manipulation
- Integers
- Multiple repetitions 
- Data entry
- Take advantage of Github Copilot suggestions

3 - Simple Mathematical Operations üìê
Description: We will ask for two numbers as input and then we will perform a simple operation between them.

What will we learn?

- Simple mathematical operations
- Data entry
- Efficient use of Github Copilot

4 - Checking odd and even numbers  üßÆ
Description: As input, receive an integer and check if it is odd or even. A tip is: use conditionals to perform the verification and, if possible, use Github Copilot (or another IA) to optimize the code structure. 

What will we learn?

- Using conditionals in Python (if, else) to perform checks. 
- Introduction to the concept of modulus operator (%) to check if a number is even or odd.
- Exploring the use of an AI tool, such as Github Copilot to optimize code structure
  
5 - Calculating grade point average  üìö
Description: now, let's calculate the average of three scores provided in the user input. A tip is: use arithmethic operators to perform the average calculation.

What will we learn?

- Using variables to store user-supplied data.
- Application of arithmetic operators (+,/) to calculate the average of a set of values.
- Practice prompting and handling user input

6 - Checking palindromes üîÑ
Description: let's test if a word is a palindrome?! A tip is: Use string manipulation concepts to invert the word and compare it with the original 

What will we learn?

- String manipulation in Python, especially reversing a string
- Understanding how to compare the original string with its reversed version to determine if it is a palindrome
- Introduction to the concept of palindromes and their application in programming problems
